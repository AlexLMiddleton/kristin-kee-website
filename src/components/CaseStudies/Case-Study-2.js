            <p>Like most small business owners, this one had a lot on her plate.  She ran multiple small businesses and was an expert at what she did.  However, if you are a small business owner, you know at some point, something has to give.</p>
            <p>You <i>can</i> do it all, because you are awesome like that, but do you want to?  Is it worth the time, money, and frustration spent to master something new?</p>
            <p>That’s where we came in.  At the end of a long, hard work day, social media was the last thing on her mind.  We provided our expertise to alleviate some of her burden, so she could focus her time and energy elsewhere.</p>
            <p>Our first step in working together was to discuss her business goals and how social media can help achieve those.  Next, we performed a detailed social media audit of the business’ existing Instagram account and used this information to create a social media strategy tailored to her business goals.</p>
            <p>We targeted a specific demographic, utilizing a content calendar with customized content, which was pushed out at optimized times.  We focused on <i><strong>organically</strong></i> (no money spent on ads) growing her engagement rate and follower growth rate in order to strengthen brand recognition.</p>
            <p>Within the first month of implementing a highly customized calendar, <strong>we increased the engagement rate by 704%</strong>.  Additionally, <strong>the follower growth rate increased by 21% the first month and another 22% the next month</strong>.</p>
            <p>We continued to monitor the results in the months ahead and continue today to optimize the strategy based on performance and the client’s feedback.</p>
            <p>So, what is engagement rate and why is it so important?  Engagement rate measures the level of <i>engagement</i> that a piece of created content is receiving from an audience. Meaning, it shows how much people interact with the content, by way of their comments, shares, and likes.  The higher the engagement rate, the better indicator it is of great content and great strategy on when and how you share that content.</p>
            <p>As a small business owner, here are the factors to consider with engagement rates - It’s not just what content you post, it’s also when and where you post it.  You should ask yourself, <i>“Is my content optimized for my target audience?”</i></p>
            <p>Additionally, engagement rates and algorithms go hand in hand.  Social media algorithms are a way of sorting posts in a users' feed based on <i>relevancy</i>. Social networks prioritize which content a user sees in their feed first by the likelihood that they'll <i>actually want to see it.</i></p>
            <p>The higher your business’ engagement rate, the higher you will get bumped up in the algorithm, making it more likely that your content will actually be seen by your target audience.  Algorithms are constantly changing, making it necessary to continually analyze the efficacy of your social media posts.</p>
