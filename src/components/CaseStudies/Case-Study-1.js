            <p>Non-profit organizations have a lot of moving parts, especially those with multiple verticals under one roof.  With so much going on, how do you distinguish each brand, while at the same time maintaining a consistent look and feel across the entire organization?</p>
            <p>And that’s just for starters.  Once each brand is clearly defined, how do you consistently tell each brand’s story in an engaging way?</p>
            <p>Non-profits, like many small business owners, have so much going on during any given day that posting on social media can feel like an afterthought.</p>
            <p>That’s where we came in.  This organization understood that they had a story to tell but needed help with the nitty gritty aspects of it.  They needed help with consistency and clarity of posting on social media.  Did their story align with their brand?</p>
            <p>Our first step in working together was a precursor necessary before moving onto discussing their business goals.  We sat through a handful of internal, company meetings in order to make sense of all their moving parts.  Each of the multiple verticals needed their own branding and story before we could dive head first into social media.</p>
            <p>Once each brand and their goals were defined, we performed a detailed social media audit of the business’ existing Facebook accounts and used this information to create a social media strategy tailored to their business goals.</p>
            <p>We focused on creating engaging content that distinguished each vertical from one another, while at the same time maintaining a consistent look and feel within the non-profit.</p>
            <p>We trained employees on best practices for social media usage, including the use of content calendars, how to create/repurpose engaging content, and optimum times/platforms for posting.  When best practices are used with consistency, brand recognition follows.</p>
            <p>Within the first month of implementing social media best practices for their organization, <strong>we increased the engagement rate by 923%</strong>.  This was using just one $37 ad that we created on Facebook over 10 days.  Without the ad money spent, <strong>the organic engagement rate increase was 139%</strong>.  Additionally, the follower growth rate increased by 12% the first month and another 10% the next month.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, we created the content for a fundraiser that helped the non-profit raise nearly $5000 on Facebook.</p>
            <p>We continued to monitor the results in the months ahead and optimized the strategy based on performance and the client’s feedback.</p>
